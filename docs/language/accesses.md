# Accesses and projections

Fe has mutable value semantics: every value has one owner, and a reference
is never a value. Code reaches another owner's data through an *access*,
which exists only as a parameter, a binding, or the result of a projection,
and ends at its last use.

## Parameter modes

```fe
fn total(_ xs: [u256; 4]) -> u256 { .. }    // view: read the caller's place
fn bump(_ x: mut u256) { x += 1 }           // mut: exclusive for the call
fn consume(_ item: own Item) { .. }         // own: the callee takes the value
```

A view or `mut` argument is a place of the caller's (`bump(mut counter)`);
an owned argument is moved, or copied if its type is `Copy`.

A view argument that is a scalar or a handle (an integer, `bool`,
`Address`, a raw pointer, or any `core::marker::Snapshot` type) is a
*snapshot*: the callee gets a copy, and the caller may change the original
during the call. Every other value, including `Copy` arrays and structs and
storage collections, is viewed in place: the caller cannot write it while the
call, or a projection's result over it, is in use.

```fe
fn first(_ xs: [u256; 4]) -> ref u256 { ref xs[0] }

let x = ref first(xs)
xs[1] = 5        // rejected: `x` views `xs` in place
```

## Bindings

`let` binds an immutable value, and `var` a mutable one; neither is ever an
access. `let h = mut p.x` and `let r = ref p.x` bind an access to a place,
with the marker on the initializer. An access is open from the binding to
its last use, and while it is open no other access may overlap it unless
both read: `p.x` cannot be read while `h` is open, nor written while `r` is.
`let mut x = …` is not Fe: write `var x = …` for a mutable value, or
`let x = mut p` for a mutable access.

```fe
var total = 0          // a mutable value
let h = mut p.x        // a mutable access to `p.x`
let r = ref p.y        // a read access to `p.y`
```

In a pattern, a binding's marker sits on its name: `x` takes a value,
`var x` a mutable value, `ref x` a read access and `mut x` a mutable access.
A pattern matched against a place opens each marked binding's access on that
binding's own part of the place, and nothing else: in
`match p { Pair { ref a, mut b, .. } => … }`, `p.a` is held for reading and
`p.b` for writing, and `p.c` stays free. `mut x` needs a mutable place or
access behind it, and `ref` or `mut` on an owned value is an error. Markers
go on the names only: `match ref x`, `if let Some(v) = mut o` and
`let (a, b) = mut t` are errors, fixed by marking each name
(`match x { V(ref v) => … }`). A marker on the scrutinee would hold all of
it, or make plain names write through.

A plain name takes its value as `let x = e` does: a copy of a `Copy` value,
and otherwise a move where one is possible. A move out of an owned place
leaves it partially moved; a move through a `mut` access leaves a hole that
must be restored through that access before it closes:

```fe
fn take(_ x: mut Option<MemBuffer>) -> Option<MemBuffer> {
    let v = x                 // moves out, leaving a hole in `x`
    x = Option::None          // restores it
    v
}
```

A value reached through a view or a `ref` access, or in storage, cannot
move; bind it `ref` to read it in place.

An owned parameter is immutable unless declared `var x: own T`, and an owned
receiver unless declared `var own self`. An access
cannot be stored in a field, in storage, passed as `own` or returned from an
ordinary function. `ref` and `mut` do not appear in types.

## Projections

A function whose result is `ref T`, `mut T`, or a shape with such a
component, is a projection: it grants its caller an access.

```fe
fn first(mut self) -> mut T { mut self.items[0] }

fn entry(mut self, _ key: u256) -> mut u256 {
    var tmp = self.get(key)
    yield mut tmp
    self.set(key, tmp)
}
```

A projection's result binds like a place. A plain name takes a value: a
`ref` result of a `Copy` type is copied, and the access ends at once, so
`let v = xs[i]` is an owned value and `xs` may change while `v` lives. A
`ref` result of any other type is an error whose fix is `let v = ref xs[i]`,
which keeps the access; `(i, ref x)` and `for ref x in xs` do the same for a
component and an element. Whether a type is `Copy` is decided by the
body's declared bounds, never by an instance. A `mut` result bound whole by
`let` stays an access (`let x = xs.at_mut(0)`), since a copy would discard
the writes the call asks for; `var x = xs.at_mut(0)` copies the element and
warns, since writes to `x` reach nothing. The components of a `mut` result
take values as a place's do, so `Some(mut v)` writes through and a plain
`Some(v)` is an immutable copy. A type with no value reading binds its read
access under a plain name: a `#[view]` result (`let s = buf.span()`), and a
state-only one (`let m = store.balances`); `let t = s` reborrows the access
the same way.

Copying a result ends the projection's session at the binding, so its slide
runs there rather than at the binding's last use.

A projection yields once on each path that completes, implicitly at its
tail or with `yield`. The code after a `yield`, its *slide*, runs when the
caller's last use of the access has passed. While the caller uses the
access, the projection's session reserves the places its arguments named.

A yield of a value, such as `-> ref u32 { self.word.low() }`, grants a
temporary in the projection's frame holding it, as `let tmp = ..; ref tmp`
would. A `ref` yield of a place views the place; a `mut` yield grants a
place only when it is named `mut`, since `self.v` alone reads a copy. A
`mut` yield of a frame temporary with no slide to write it back is a
warning.

A shape groups owned values and accesses, `-> (usize, ref T)`, and the
caller destructures it with `let (i, x) = ..`. Two `mut` components must be
structurally disjoint, as in `(mut self.a, mut self.b)`. An optional shape,
`-> Option<mut T>` or `-> Result<mut T, E>`, is consumed with `if let`,
`match`, `let .. else` or `?`; its empty variant may only be returned before
the `yield`.

Each access a projection grants lies in one address space, its *result
space*. The compiler infers it from the body, and a signature may declare it
after a component or after the whole return: a space (`@memory`, `@storage`,
`@transient`, `@calldata`, `@code`), a parameter's or effect's place
(`@self`, `@total`), a sub-place of one (`@self.value`, `@self.pair.0`,
`@self.cells[_]`), the resource a handle names (`@target(p)`), or an
associated space (`@S`). A sub-place lies where its path leads: a step into a
pinned type moves it into the pin's space, an entry into its collection's
`SPACE`, and a packed field or entry is reached through a memory copy, so
its grants lie in memory. Every yield must lie in the declared space, so
`@self` on a struct holding a `TSlot` does not cover a yield of the `TSlot`'s
value, while `@self.locked` does. An implementation gives its trait's
`space S` the same way; `space S = self[_]` says its elements are its own
parts, which is memory for packed elements.

```fe
fn value_mut(mut self) -> mut T @self.value { mut self.value }

impl<T> Collection for Cells<T> {
    space S = self[_]       // where its elements lie: memory for packed ones
    ..
}
```

A tuple holds accesses only as such a shape. Accesses the checker cannot see
are disjoint form an *unsafe split*, an `unsafe` block whose tail is a tuple
of them: one session whose reservations are all of theirs, and whose grants
the block promises are disjoint. Its components are places, such as raw
pointer dereferences, or calls of `#[raw_place]` projections: a projection
declared `#[raw_place]` has nothing to resume after its yield, since no code
runs there, it keeps no access or session of its own open across it, and it
yields no place of its own frame, which is checked where it is written. Two
raw-slot collections, whose `at` constructors are raw places, are held at
once this way, and `MemArray::pair_mut` is one inside a library function:

```fe
let (mut a, mut b) = unsafe { (SolArray<u256>::at(x), SolArray<u256>::at(y)) }
a.push(1)                           // all storage stays reserved until both end
b.push(2)
```

## Views

A type marked `#[view]`, such as `MemSlice`, describes memory its owner
holds. It has no value: no `own` parameter or owned result, no `Copy`, no
field of that type, and nothing for `var` to hold; a plain binding of one is
its read access. A span such as `buffer.span()` is a `ref` projection, so it
keeps the buffer reserved until its last use.

A view may also be accessed mutably. `buffer.span_mut()` holds the buffer
mutably until the span's last use, and writes through the span reach the
buffer:

```fe
let s = buffer.span_mut()
s[0] = 10
let (mut head, mut tail) = s.split_at_mut(4)
for mut b in tail { b = 0 }
```

A view never leaves a hole: a move out of a `mut` access of one is rejected,
including inside generic code such as a `swap<T>` called with two spans, so
two spans cannot exchange the owners they point into. A projection that
yields a `mut` view must hold something mutably, a `mut` parameter or
effect.

## Indexing

`c[k]` has one syntax and two kinds of implementation. Indexing a fixed array
`[T; N]` is built in. A collection whose elements live in storage or
transient storage implements `core::ops::StateIndex` (below): it only says
where an entry lies, and the compiler opens the entry's place, so its users
need no raw storage authority. Any other collection implements
`core::ops::Index` and `IndexMut`, whose `index` and `index_mut` are
projections: their bodies may check bounds, compute an element or write one
back, and an element's access reserves the whole collection until its last
use. A memory owner such as `MemArray` yields an element through its pointer
in an `unsafe` block; growing it takes `mut self`, so it cannot reallocate
under an open element access.

## Storage collections

A storage collection, such as a `StorageMap`, `StoragePackedArray` or
`TSlot`, is an owner at its storage place: the contract layout gives it a
slot, and its entries lie at slots derived from that one (a map's at
`keccak(key, slot)`). `m[k]` names an entry's place with no call
(`core::ops::StateIndex`), so `store.days[k].steps += 1` reads and writes one
slot. The access checker sees an entry as the collection's place indexed by a
key: entries at distinct literal keys are disjoint, and any other two
overlap. A `mut` access to a struct holding collections covers their
entries. A collection's methods take `self` or `mut self` and declare no
effects: the authority is the access to its place, as for any data.

A library type becomes a collection by implementing `core::ops::StateIndex`:
`SPACE`, a `core::effect_ref::StateSpace`, names the state space its entries
live in, `Key` and `Entry` the index and the
element type, and `locate(root, key)` returns the entry's slot and bit
offset for the collection rooted at slot `root`. `locate` declares no
effects; the compiler calls it once when an access to `c[k]` opens and does
the loads, stores and masking itself. It must keep every entry inside the
collection's own region, hashing per entry or bounding the key, since the
compiler trusts it to.

A collection may pack small elements into lanes of shared slots, as a
`SolArray` does for Solidity's packed array elements. Its `Lanes` codec
(`core::ops::LaneCodec<Entry>`) packs an element coded in at most 128
`BITS`, and `locate` can read `BITS` to step between elements. `SolArray`'s
codec, `SolLanes`, uses an element's `SolPacked` encoding, and the compiler
gives any other element `BITS` of 256 per slot its storage layout takes. A
lane is read and written in place, but a `mut` binding, argument, provided
effect or yield of one works on a memory copy that is stored back into the
lane when the access ends.

```fe
let x = mut balances[from]
balances.set(key: to, value: 0)     // rejected: `x` holds an entry of `balances`
x -= amount
```

A `StateIndex` collection is *pinned* to its `SPACE`; implementing the
trait is the whole declaration, so a library collection is pinned the same
way. A type
holding a pinned type is *state-only*: never a value. It is not constructed,
copied, moved out of storage or held in a memory aggregate; code reaches it
through an access, a `mut` or view parameter, or an effect, and a plain
binding of one (`let m = store.balances`) is its read access. A place's space
follows its path: a field or element of a pinned type lies in the type's
space, so a `TSlot` and its value lie in transient storage whatever holds
the `TSlot`. A raw-slot constructor,
`unsafe fn at(slot) -> mut Self uses (storage: mut RawStorage)`, places a
collection at a runtime slot, and its caller vouches that nothing else uses
that slot. A `with` block may install a provider naming storage only when its
place lies in one of the function's effects, under raw storage authority, or
in an `unsafe` block.

## External calls

A call that may start an external execution can reenter the contract and
access any of its storage, so it conflicts with every open storage access,
including those of the projections whose results the caller still uses.
Close storage accesses, or let their last use pass, before such a call.
